title: Race Into Space
---
*Race Into Space* a free software version of the *Liftoff!* board game by Fritz Bronner, originally developed by Strategic Visions and published by Interplay in 1993 and 1994 as [Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin%27s_Race_into_Space).

This project was born in 2005, when the original developers re-obtained rights to the game and released it under the GPL. The project made many releases, each containing more bug fixes and minor features, until releasing 1.0 in 2011.

# Here to play?

The most recent stable version of the game is available from our [SourceForge project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/raceintospace/). It runs natively on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux; no emulator is required.
